# üîê IKEv2 Simulation using UDP Sockets

### Overview

This project is a **Python-based simulation** of the **Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2)** protocol ‚Äî the key management protocol used by IPsec VPNs.

It demonstrates the **main message exchanges** defined in [RFC 7296](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7296):

1. **IKE_SA_INIT** ‚Äì performs Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange and nonce exchange.
2. **IKE_AUTH** ‚Äì authenticates peers and establishes the IKE Security Association (IKE SA).
3. **CREATE_CHILD_SA** ‚Äì creates one or more Child SAs that actually protect data traffic (the most distinctive feature of IKEv2).

After these phases, the simulation **exhibits the Child SA** by encrypting and decrypting a sample ‚ÄúIP packet‚Äù payload to show how protected traffic flows once the negotiation is complete.

## üß† Learning Goals

This simulation aims to provide a hands-on understanding of:

* The **message flow** and **states** of IKEv2.
* How **Diffie‚ÄìHellman** key exchange is used to derive shared secrets.
* How **nonces** and **labels** contribute to key derivation.
* The role of the **Child SA** in separating traffic protection from IKE control.
* Basic **encryption/decryption** demonstration of an IPsec-protected payload.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

* Implemented entirely using **Python UDP sockets** (no external VPN tools required).
* Simulates:

  * IKE_SA_INIT (exchange of DH public values and nonces)
  * IKE_AUTH (authentication using HMAC over a shared key)
  * CREATE_CHILD_SA (child SA negotiation)
  * Encrypted sample ‚ÄúIP packet‚Äù exchange via AES-GCM or XOR fallback
* Lightweight, readable, and designed for experimentation and study.

## üß™ Running the Simulation

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Optionally install `cryptography` for real AES-GCM encryption:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Responder (Server)

```bash
python ikev2_responder.py --port 5000
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Initiator (Client)

```bash
python ikev2_initiator.py --peer 127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Observe the Exchange

You should see the following progression in your terminals:

**Initiator:**

```
[*] IKE_SA_INIT complete. Derived IKE SK.
[*] IKE_AUTH verified. IKE_SA established.
[*] Requesting CREATE_CHILD_SA
[*] Child SA established. Child key derived.
[*] Sending sample traffic protected by Child SA
[RECV] CHILD_TRAFFIC_ACK ok
```

**Responder:**

```
[*] IKE_SA_INIT received
[SENT] IKE_SA_INIT_RESP
[*] IKE_AUTH received - verifying auth
[+] AUTH verified. IKE_SA established.
[*] CREATE_CHILD_SA received
[SENT] CREATE_CHILD_RESP (child established)
[*] CHILD_TRAFFIC received (encrypted payload)
[+] Decrypted child-traffic payload: Hello from initiator - this is protected by Child SA
```

This output confirms that both peers derived matching keys and successfully used the Child SA to protect traffic.

## üîç Understanding the Child SA Demonstration

In IKEv2, the **IKE SA** protects IKE control messages, while **Child SAs** protect user traffic (ESP, AH).

This simulation explicitly **shows the difference**:

* The initial IKE SA handles negotiation and authentication.
* The **Child SA** key is separately derived using:

  ```
  child_key = SHA256(IKE_SK || label || Ni || Nr)
  ```
* The initiator encrypts a test payload with the `child_key` and sends it.
* The responder decrypts it successfully ‚Äî proving the child SA is functioning.

This mirrors how real IPsec tunnels protect user traffic after IKE negotiation.

---

## üß† Educational Extensions

You can extend this simulation further by:

* Implementing **HKDF** for stronger key derivation.
* Adding **SPIs** (Security Parameter Indexes) to identify SAs.
* Supporting **multiple Child SAs** (each with distinct keys).
* Simulating **rekeying** via another `CREATE_CHILD_SA` exchange.
* Exporting messages to a JSON ‚Äúpacket log‚Äù for visualization.
